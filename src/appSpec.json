        "designSummary": "**Zen Garden: The AI Artisan's Silent Stage**\n\nThe Vision: The website will embody the principles of minimalism, acting as a serene and unobtrusive backdrop for the AI-powered artisan video generator. The design prioritizes functionality and clarity, ensuring a seamless user experience. Inspired by the tranquility of a Zen garden, the layout will guide the user through the process with intuitive simplicity.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Strict Grid System: A 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure, ensuring perfect alignment and visual order.\n2. Monochromatic Palette: The color scheme will be limited to black, white, and shades of gray, creating a clean and distraction-free environment. A single accent color (e.g., primary) will be used sparingly for interactive elements.\n3. Typographic Hierarchy: A single sans-serif font (Roboto) will be used throughout the site. Hierarchy will be established through variations in size, weight, and case.\n4. Minimalist Components: UI elements will be stripped down to their essential forms, devoid of any unnecessary decoration. Whitespace will be used generously to create visual breathing room.",

Inspired by the tranquility of a Zen garden, the layout will guide the user through the process with intuitive simplicity.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Strict Grid System: A 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure, ensuring perfect alignment and visual order.\n2. Monochromatic Palette: The color scheme will be limited to black, white, and shades of gray, creating a clean and distraction-free environment. A single accent color (e.g., primary) will be used sparingly for interactive elements.\n3. Typographic Hierarchy: A single sans-serif font (Roboto) will be used throughout the site. Hierarchy will be established through variations in size, weight, and case.\n4. Minimalist Components: UI elements will be stripped down to their essential forms, devoid of any unnecessary decoration. Whitespace will be used generously to create visual breathing room.",

Endpoint POST /api/generate-video to combine image + audio into a video (placeholder for now). 4. Allow CORS and handle file uploads via Multer.
